# Morse code (code)
Making a code to play morse code. Very basic code.


## Why?
Other students where working with a beeper, it was irritating. So I made sweet sweet revenge. Enjoy how ever you want to use it.


## HWLIB libary
I used a libary of my school. So this code only works in hwlib at the moment. Maby in the future I decide to make it for Arduino global use.

If you really needed then you just have to create a Arduino pin of the trigger. And use Arduino waits instead of the hwlib. Good luck
